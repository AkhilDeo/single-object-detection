# Single Object Detection

This project uses YoloV8 to detect a hammer object (or really any object). One file utilizes a standard 70/30 train-test split, while the other uses the entire dataset for training, as testing can be done offline and there are likely limited use cases, scenarios, and evironments in which a basic single object detection model would be used.
